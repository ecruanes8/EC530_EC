This is the read me for Assignment 1. 

I used Github Copilot and the Haversine formula to complete this assignment. 

Summary - Contains exercise1.py which matches each geo location in array1 to array2 with least distance. 

Running the code - To run the code, there is already an example of array1 and array2. Change the points to test and then run python exercise1.py in the terminal. This should return the correct matches.
